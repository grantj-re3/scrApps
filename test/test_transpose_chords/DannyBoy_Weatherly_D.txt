Frederic Edward Weatherly (1848-1929)
Key: [D]

[D][A7] Oh Danny [D]bo-[Dmaj7]y, the [D7]pipes, the pipes are [G]calling [Gm]
From glen to [D]glen and [Bm]down the mountain [E7]side [A]
The [A7]summer's [D]gon-[Dmaj7]e and [D7]all the leaves are [G]falling [Gm]
'Tis you, 'tis [D]yo-[Bm]u must [Em]go and [A]I must [D]bide [G][D]

But [A]come ye [D]back when [G]summer's in the [D]meadow
[A]Or [Bm]when [A/C#]the [Bm]valley's [G]hushed and [D]white with [E7]snow [A]
And I'll be [D]her-[D/F#]e in [G]sunshine or in [D/D]sha-[D/C#]d-[Bm/B]ow [Gm]
Oh Danny [D]boy, oh Danny [Em]boy I [A]love you [D]so [G][D]

But [A7]if he [D]co-[Dmaj7]me and [D7]all the roses [G]dying [Gm]
And I am [D/D]dea-[D/C#]d, as [Bm/B]dead I [Bm/A]well may [E/E]be [E/G#][A/A]
You'll [A7]come and [D]fin-[Dmaj7]d the [D7]place where I am [G]lying [Gm]
And kneel and [D]say [Bm] an [Em]Ave [A]there for [D]me [G][D]

And [A]I shall [D]feel, though [G]soft you tread a-[D]bove me
[A]And [Bm]then [A/C#]my [Bm]gra-[Bm/A]ve will [G]richer, [D]sweeter [E7]be [A]
For you will [D]bend [D/F#]
  and [G]tell me that you [D/D]lo-[D/C#]ve [Bm/B]me [Bb]
And I shall [D]rest in [Bm]peace un-[Em]til you [A]come to [D]me [G][D]
