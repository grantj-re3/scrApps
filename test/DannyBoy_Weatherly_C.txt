Key: [C]

[C][G7] Oh Danny [C]bo-[Cmaj7]y, the [C7]pipes, the pipes are [F]calling [Fm]
From glen to [C]glen and [Am]down the mountain [D7]side [G]
The [G7]summer's [C]gon-[Cmaj7]e and [C7]all the leaves are [F]falling [Fm]
'Tis you, 'tis [C]yo-[Am]u must [Dm]go and [G]I must [C]bide [F][C]

But [G]come ye [C]back when [F]summer's in the [C]meadow
[G]Or [Am]when [G/B]the [Am]valley's [F]hushed and [C]white with [D7]snow [G]
And I'll be [C]her-[C/E]e in [F]sunshine or in [C/C]sha-[C/B]d-[Am/A]ow [Fm]
Oh Danny [C]boy, oh Danny [Dm]boy I [G]love you [C]so [F][C]

But [G7]if he [C]co-[Cmaj7]me and [C7]all the roses [F]dying [Fm]
And I am [C/C]dea-[C/B]d, as [Am/A]dead I [Am/G]well may [D/D]be [D/F#][G/G]
You'll [G7]come and [C]fin-[Cmaj7]d the [C7]place where I am [ F ]lying [Fm]
And kneel and [C]say [Am] an [Dm]Ave [G]there for [C]me [F][C]

And [G]I shall [C]feel, though [F]soft you tread a-[C]bove me
[G]And [Am]then [G/B]my [Am]gra-[Am/G]ve will [F]richer, [C]sweeter [D7]be [G]
For you will [C]bend [C/E]
  and [F]tell me that you [C/C]lo-[C/B]ve [Am/A]me [G#]
And I shall [C]rest in [Am]peace un-[Dm]til you [G]come to [C]me [F][C]
